## Show

- Installation
- Generation
- Client... headers
- Suspense
- `graphql` HOC
- `query`
- Polling confusion
- Variable confusion
- Custom client side extensions (click a ship)

## Loving

- Interesting concept
- Avoiding "double declaration problem"
- Types are supported out of box for entire graphql schema

## Lacking

- I found myself looking at the network tab to see what queries were being produced... is there too much abstraction?
- Super bleeding edge: Lack of examples, community, support
- Documentation
- Mutations?
- Subscriptions?
- Running into TS errors when working with variables
- Polling... confusing
- Errors running TS in "strict" mode
- Requires TS

## Conclusion

- Stick with Apollo
- Watch where this project goes in future
- GraphQL aint so bad
